# Flask-Tutorial

## Description

The purpose of this project is to help me get experience working with Flask by following the [Flask tutorial made by Corey M. Schafer](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog). Furthmore, I am going to be following along by doing development in a Docker container and using the Gitflow workflow in order to get experience with both.
